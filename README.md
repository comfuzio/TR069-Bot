## Project description 
Discord bot for remote management and statistics collection bot for discord, Technicolor modems and PfSense.


## feature set 
The target future set will be the following 
* Display on discord message xDSL statistics, 
* On request display graphs of these statistics
* Alert Network admin for any issues:
- high error rates, CGNAT  
- interface status changes

* How CRC /FEC errors are displayed on the RRD graph. 
A) standard, rolling graph, which shows the errors over time 
B) every 24h submit to the RRD the sum of the daysâ€™ worth of errors, 
That shows the points in time that peaked in errors. 

* Interact with the modem to re sync the line 


## Current progress of the project. 
* PfSense fauxapi & Python works 
* Parsing stats from TG789v V3 via ssh works 
* Discord messaging works via `NextCord`

TBD:
* VDSL uptime messages
* Alerts: CRC alerts (lots in a small time), DeSync, ReSync.
* onRequest: WAN_IP, Uptime 
* Alarms on high error counts
* CMD for restarting modem sync
* Displaying the RRD graphs, On discord
* Finalize The grafana Dashboard.
